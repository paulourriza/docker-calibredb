# note on modifications
This is a slight modification on jakbutler/docker-calibredb that uses inotify-tools to watch the import folder and auto-converts non-mobi files to mobi and adds them back to the database. Otherwise, it is behaves exactly the same as jakbutler intended and the rest of his readme still applies.

What follows is jakbutler's original readme.md

# docker-calibredb
A lightweight docker container, based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), for running the [calibredb](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/calibredb.html) backend component to auto-import new books into a library. Intended to work in tandem with other containers running other parts of [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) or serving up its library.

# What is this? 
Many of the existing calibre containers are designed around running the calibre-server or similar ([COPS](https://github.com/seblucas/cops), [calibre2odps](https://calibre2opds.com/), [CalibreWeb](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web), etc.) and they do it well; but few provided a reliable method for automatically importing new eBooks from a downloader such as [LazyLibrarian](https://github.com/DobyTang/LazyLibrarian). This container is intended to fill that gap. 

## Usage
```
docker create --name=calibredb \
              -e AUTO_UPDATE="1" \
              -v </path/to/calibre/config>:/opt/calibredb/config:rw \
              -v </path/to/calibre/import>:/opt/calibredb/import:rw \
              -v </path/to/calibre/library>:/opt/calibredb/library:rw \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
        jakbutler/docker-calibredb
        /usr/bin/run_auto_importer.sh
```
## Parameters

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a volume `-v external:internal` - what this shows is the volume mapping from internal to external of the container.
So `-v ~/calibre/library:/opt/calibredb/library` would expose a folder from the user's home directory to be accessible from the container at the mount point `/opt/calibredb/library`.

The below tables list the supported parameters for the container, not all of which are required. 

#### Environment Variables

| Variable  | Description  | Default  |
| --------  | -----------  | -------  |
| `AUTO_UPDATE`  | A boolean (0\|1) environment variable flag indicating whether or not to update the calibre version when the container starts | `0` |   
| `CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`  | A calibre environment variable; specific the local directory where the application configurations are stored. | `/opt/calibredb/config` |
| `CALIBREDB_IMPORT_DIRECTORY`  | A custom environment variable for specifying the local directory where the new files to import will be saved; after import, all files will be removed from this directory. | `/opt/calibre/import` |
| `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY`  | A calibre environment variable; specifies the local directory where the library metadata and files are stored. | `/opt/calibredb/library` |
**Please note:** If over-ridding the defaults for any of the directory variables, they should not overlap with the calibre install location (`/opt/calibre`) or the auto update functionality will break. After over-riding, it is import to use the same values when mapping the host and container volumes, below.   

#### Shared Volumes

| Volume  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/opt/calibredb/config`  | (Required) The local directory where the application configurations are stored, specified in the `CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` environment variable.  |
| `/opt/calibredb/import`  | (Required) The local directory where the new files to import will be saved, specified in the `CALIBREDB_IMPORT_DIRECTORY` environment variable.|
| `/opt/calibredb/library`  | (Required) The local directory where the library metadata and files are stored, specified in the `CALIBRE_LIBERARY_DIRECTORY` environment variable.  |

## Other Details
On startup, the container should execute the command `/usr/bin/run_auto_importer.sh` in order to perform the auto-importing and stay running. 

For shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it calibredb /bin/bash`

## Install on unRaid
On unRaid, install from the **Community Repositories** and enter the required folder locations.

## Install on QNAP
On a QNAP, install using the Create Container page of **ContainerStation**. Search for *calibredb* and select the image from the **Docker Hub** tab and click **Create**. Specify the desired name and set the **Command** to `/usr/bin/run_auto_importer.sh`. Adjust CPU and Memory limits as desired, then click on **Advanced Settings >>** to specify the environment variable and volume mappings. Click **Create** when done.   

## Versions
+ **2016-12-29:** Initial release.
